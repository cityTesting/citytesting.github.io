Selenoid is a implementation of Selenium hub using Golang, it uses docker containers to launch the browsers.

**Configuration**
* Make sure that you have docker installed in your machine.
* Download Configuration Manager of Selenoid from [here](https://github.com/aerokube/cm/releases).
* Rename the file that you downloaded to cm.
* If you are using linux or mac give privilegies to the file.
```
chmod +x cm
```
* Start selenoid
```
./cm selenoid start --vnc
```
You can stop it whenever you need using: 
```
./cm selenoid stop
```
* Start selenoid-ui
```
./cm selenoid-ui start
```
You can stop it with:
```
./cm selenoi-ui stop
```

Now we can run the tests as we would do with selenium but using the endpoint [http://localhost:4444/wd/hub](http://localhost:4444/wd/hub).

In order to check the status of selenoid you can go to [http://localhost:4444/status](http://localhost:4444/status) and to open selenoid-ui [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
