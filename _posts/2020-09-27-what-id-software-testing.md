categories: [testing]

**Software testing** is the process to check that the software matches the expected requirements. It can be divided into two categories:

* Functional: It is the process to ensure that the software does what is defined in the requirements. We can divide the functional testing in three layers:
- Unit: Every component is tested isolated. It used to test methods/functions.
- Integration: With these tests the "communication" between two components is checked. For example, if our product uses a database, the integration between thems checked with this testing.
- End-to-End: Here the completed system is tested.

* Non-functional: the tests of this category check different aspects of the product, performance, security, usability....
